# SQL Project Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Project Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of SQL-based projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in database design, query optimization, data analysis, and performance tuning. Each project includes detailed documentation, SQL scripts, and insights drawn from real-world datasets, highlighting various aspects of database management and analytics.
Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and reach out with any questions or feedback.
