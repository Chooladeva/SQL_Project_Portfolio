# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project (My 1st SQL Project)

This SQL project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 using datasets containing information on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The project begins by inspecting and retrieving records from the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables, followed by analyzing key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and their percentages relative to population. It explores country-level and continent-level trends, identifying the highest affected regions in terms of cases, deaths, and fatality rates. Additionally, the project calculates global statistics, including the overall death percentage. A key focus is also placed on vaccination trends, where cumulative vaccination counts and the percentage of vaccinated individuals are computed using window functions.
